Class GenericQ:

Contains 3 methods:
1.private static void m1(MyStack<? extends A3> aStack): 

Takes arguments in the form of a stack Mystack that accepts the object of the type that is a subclass of A3 or itself referred to as "aStack". In this case, since no other class extends A3, only A3 would be accepted.

2.private static void m2(MyStack<?> aStack): 

Takes arguments in the form of a stack Mystack that accepts any object of MyStack and is referred to as "aStack". Unbounded wildcard

3.private static void m3(MyStack<? super A3> aStack):

Takes arguments in the form of a stack Mystack that accepts the object of the type that is a parent of A3 or itself referred to as "aStack". In this case, it can accept objects of type A3, A2, A1.



public static void testMyStack() method:
8 objects were created:
1.aMyStack: Of type Mystack that accepts an Integer object.

2.aVector: Of type Vector which contains a Mystack that holds an Integer object.

3.bMyStack: Of type Mystack which contains a Mystack that holds an Integer object.

4.bVector: Of type Vector which contains a Mystack which contains a Mystack that holds an Integer object.

5. aA1: Of type Mystack that contains objects of type A1.
6.aA2: Of type Mystack that contains objects of type A2.
7.aA3: Of type Mystack that contains objects of type A3.
8.aA4: Of type Mystack that contains objects of type A4.
