noSystemExit method would create compilation error because:
1) First try block is processed and error is thrown there and immediately the catch is called, which prints "2" and returns 0
2) Which makes the return block after finally unreachable.

noException method execution:
1) First try block is executed. Prints inside try: 1, catch is not executed. 
2) Finally block is executed and prints "inside finally: 3". And returns 3.

anException1 method execution:
1) an exception occurs in the try block. Then execution in the catch block starts
2) an exception in the catch block occurs and control is passed on to the finally block.
3) Finally block prints inside finally 3 and returns 2, since it is returning 2, exception is swallowed

An Exception2 method execution:
1) An exception in the try block occurs, control is  not passed on to the catch
2) Because the it is not catching the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
3) finally blocks starts executing, prints "inside finally: 3") and returns 2 which makes the exception to get discarded

withSystemExit method execution:
1) an exception occurs in the try block control is passed on to the catch block
2) 5 is printed and exited 
3) Program ends then and there.
