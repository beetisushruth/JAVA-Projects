1. PasswordWrite generates the 1234.ser file by serializing the Password object
2. writeobject in the password class, has custom implementation on how to store the serialised object
3. Encode the password to a BASE64 string by appending our custom key code to it
4. PasswordRead deserialises the the 1234.ser and prints if the password has been tampered with
5. readObject in the password class, decodes the encoded password, if decoding fails, that means password has been tampered with, if the password or custom
key doesn't match the password has been tampered.
